# A few notes about quizzes

notes:
just a few more details about reading quizzes since we have some due dates for those coming up

---

## Note 1 - You (typically) get 3 tries per question

<img src="images/example_quiz_points.png">

(This might be updated for True/False questions)

notes:
right now its ~100%, 84%, 50% for each choice but we might update this for T/F questions since there are only true choices 

same with multi-check boxes, we might update this to give you more tries, but we might just leave as it to keep it simple.  

Stay tuned!

---

## Note 2 - Timed!

<img src="images/example_quiz_timed.png">

Each quiz has a *1 hour* time limit.

notes:
make sure you don't click on the link on Canvas until you are ready to take the quiz!

## Note 2 - Timed!

<img src="images/example_quiz_canvas_box.png">



notes:
The link will be on Canvas like so with big bold letters telling you not to click until you are ready.
