# A few notes about quizzes

notes:
just a few more details about reading quizzes since we have some due dates for those coming up

---

## Note 1 - You (typically) get 3 tries per question

(This might be updated for True/False questions)

notes:
right now its ~100%, 84%, 50% for each choice but we might update this for T/F questions since there are only true choices 

same with multi-check boxes, we might update this to give you more tries, but we might just leave as it to keep it simple.  

Stay tuned!
