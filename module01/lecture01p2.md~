## Some notes about this Class

Participation in this class is absolutely key.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

You will be tasked with talking, creating, sharing, and discussing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:
be aware that participation in this class is key to success

---

## Participation Guidelines

We ask that you:

 * Participate in class (questions, comments, discussion)
 * Engage with your group in class and outside of class (more about assignment groups next week)
 * Use Canvas resources & email (preferred) for communication outside of class

---

## Participation Guidelines - Presentations

<div>All presentations will be <b>in person</b> - no hybrid/online options available.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<br />

<div>This includes presentations that will take place in the last two weeks of class.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:
Please note this is an in person class so we expect you to be in person - there are no online/hybrid options for this class.  While we will make recordings of the class in case you need to miss a class, these will not be available until after the class.

**be aware** this includes ALL in class presentations, including your final presentations which will take place in the last 2 weeks of class - you will need to be here for these assignments to present with your group.


---

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 15% -- Graded in class activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 75% -- Assignments (group)

notes:
with this idea of the course, let's look at the overall way grading is going to work in this course

you will dive into the details more for the syllabus quiz, which is an assignment due next week designed to get you familiar with these details :D

the reading quizzes and in class activities are still being developed, so these are not all posted as of yet but we will update the Canvas with those items as soon as possible -- reading quizzes should be there early, but the graded activities may or may not be present until the week we will actually be doing them

There *IS* a reading list however that you can access to "look ahead" at all of the reading for the course.

also about reading quizzes: as these are new, there might be some errors in them!  if you think we got something wrong, let us know so we can fix it and update your grade accordingly!


---

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 15% -- Graded "in class" activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 75% -- Assignments (group)

notes:

**be aware** the in class activities are really "in class" activities in that some times there will be more than one assigned during class, in which case, any beyond the "main" one will be due several days after the course

more details on the graded in class activities next week when we start using them! as folks are still shifting around classes, we won't be grading any in class stuff this week

---

## Grading - Assignments

You will have five assignments:

 1. Tweet Critique (5-7 minute presentation in class with slides, in Weeks 5-10)
 2. Data Story Idea: Social Problem or Social Justice (1 page + short recording)
 3. Data Story Critique Proposal (written)
 4. Data Story Critique Final Submission (written)
 5. Recorded Data Story (3-5 minutes)
 6. Final data story (\~10 minutes max in class, last 2 weeks)
 
notes:
within the assignments category there is a break down further into individual assignments

all of these will be in groups and we'll talk a bit about how groups are going to work today but also later when we get closer to assigning the groups

---

## Groups

Working in a group is a required element of this class.

Group formation will be using the ["astromimicry" concept](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11218.pdf).

Design of group contracts will be part of an in class activity.

notes:
groups will be a combination of your selection and randomly assigned, following concepts of "astromimicry"

the basic idea is that you get to choose *one* person you want to work with and then we randomly assign you to a group with other 
folks in this "binary star" configuratioin

there will be an in class activity aimed at cementing the ways in which you will be working in a group -- i.e. how the group will communicate, how work will be divided, etc

more on this in the next week when we come to it!

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)

notes:

as I'm the nominal "data person" for this course (Prof. Zalot being the storytelling person), I just wanted to let folks know a bit about the tools we are using, namely Google Data Studio and Twine

google data studio is going to be used to build interactive visualizations in in-class activities

twine is used to make interactive text & image based online data stories and games


---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
please note that I am assuming that there are folks here that have zero programming background and that is not only fine, but it is great!

we are going to be using these resources in a way that does not require programming

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Excel/Google Sheets
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
with that in mind, if you are newer to programming and/or data analysis there are a few things you might want to check out including gaining some 
familiarity with Excel and/or Google sheets

for twine we will mostly be making use of a Markdown-like syntax which is just a more intuative way to use HTML where things like bullet points are formatted with astrexies instead of fancy HTML formatting. 

There will be one or two HTML tags we might use to do things like include images, but we won't be doing anything super fancy

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Excel/Google Sheets
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

Recommended tutorials & recordings are posted at the top of the "Modules" part of the Canvas course page.

notes:
for these topics, we will post some suggested resources including tutorials and recordings before class -- we have one for this class, but it is the first class so it is hard to do things before!

---

## Plagiarism

Academic integrity is vital to this course.  The _stories_ you tell and the
_visualizations_ you create must be your own, both in actuality and in
character.

However, there are many reasons to seek out assistance and help. We insist that
you cite every fragment of code that you utilize online.

notes:
two final things before I give the mic to Prof. Zalot who is going to introduce us to some storytelling concepts...

we will talk more about this when we get to the written submissions at Assignments 3 & 4

---

## Quick tour of our Canvas Page!

notes:
mention modules
 * assignments at top
 * each week will have reading quizzes and in-class submission placeholders for the week
 * we will also have the lecture slides, recommended readings, and any relevant resources for the week
 * we are still adding things, but are aiming to be at least a week or more ahead with material postings!

**be sure to point out tutorials and resources at top of page!**

## Naming activity & Introduction to Each Other

We're going to break up into breakout rooms, where you'll chat with each other about your *name*, or the name of a place, 
person, animal, etc that is meaningful to you.

Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?

Afterward, we'll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit, and then we will break back out.

---

## Names - Visualization

In your new breakout rooms, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

We will break *back* into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.

A few things:
 1. one person in your group will need to be logged in to google through your @illinois.edu address
 2. only one person from the group should be accessing the jamboard -- there is a limit of 50 people per jamboard
 
Questions?

notes:
**go through and then ask if folks have questions**
