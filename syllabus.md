## Welcome to the Bolashak Scholars PowerBI Workshop!

Data visualization is crucial to conveying information drawn from models,
observations or investigations. This workshop will provide a brief overview of 
visualization "best practices" and where things can "go wrong" with data viz.  
We will apply the <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/">PowerBI</a> tool for 
some practical and hands-on data visualization and analysis.

**Note on 11/24/2025 -- More details and materials to be filled in over the next few days**

## Prerequisites: Highly suggested pre-installation

#### 1. Install Excel
Prior to the workshop, please install Excel locally on your computer (if not already installed), or update to the latest version (if its been a while since you updated).

See link to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module01/lecture1p0.html">lecture slides for how to install linked here</a>.

Additionally, be sure you are signed in to your @illinois.edu account online ([https://outlook.office365.com/](https://outlook.office365.com/)) for accessing all links/materials.

#### 2. Install the Google Chrome Browser

It is highly recommended that you use the [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download) for our activities with PowerBI.

#### 3. Check you can access PowerBI

Using [this link to the online PowerBI version](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi) make sure you are able to access with your @illinois.edu account.

#### 4. (OPTIONAL) Turn on your Google Access with your @illinois.edu account

This next part may or may not work, depending on how your @illinois.edu account is set up.

First, go to the [linking dashboard](https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/cbdash/).  You will be prompted to choose your campus and likely asked to sign in.

Then click on the "Google Apps @ Illinois" button so the "ON" portion is green:

## Translating this website

Translation for materials on this website using Google Translate has not been tested fully (given the author's mono-language nature, sadly), however it is possible that this may be effective since most material is rendered as HTML.  To try this out go to [Google Translate for Webpages](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=websites) and put in the URL for the page you are interested in rendering and select your language to render to.

Some notes:
1. Translation of lecture slides is somewhat supported, however you may need to play with the zoom in/out on your browser to see slides with larger images/text
2. For some of the external links, like the [Data-to-Viz Viz-Picker](https://www.data-to-viz.com/#spider) not all elements will render from the "base" webpage.  For example if you click on the "histogram" bubble icon on this page, nothing will pop up when using Google Translate, so your best bet is to start from the non-translated version and then click on the histogram bubble, and then click on the last link called "See the dedicated page." and then render the full histogram page that pops up (for example: [https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/histogram.html](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/histogram.html).)

We will go over this in the workshop as well!
